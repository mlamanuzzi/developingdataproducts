2. Write using R Markdown
3. Use an empty line followed by three dashes to separate slides!

--- .class #id 

## Summary of Data

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models). The qualitative variables such as number of cylinders and gears were converted to factors.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(mtcars)
```

## Using the app

To use the app, simply choose the predictor of MPG that you would like to investigate.

Once chosen, a linear model is built using the selected predictor with respect to mpg.

A summary table is also shown of that variabel in the dataset.
